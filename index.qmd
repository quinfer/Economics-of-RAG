## Project Summary

- This project, led by Dr. Barry Quinn and Dr. JesÃºs MartÃ­nez del RincÃ³n from Queenâ€™s University Belfast, aims to create an AI framework to simplify and enhance regulatory compliance in global investment management. 

- First major project for [Finance and AI Research Lab](https://q-rap.connect.qub.ac.uk/FAIR/) established in 2023.

- The research focuses on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and ontology learning algorithms to transform complex regulatory texts into clear, consistent rules reflecting current international standards.

## Key Objectives 

- Explore the advantages of AI in regulatory compliance for the investment management sector.
- Evaluate AIâ€™s impact on accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
- Focus on key areas like regulatory reporting, risk assessments, and compliance monitoring.
- Address challenges in using Large Language Models (LLMs), including hallucinations, reasoning, and auditability.

## Theoretical Framework in Economics {.smaller}

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) as Adaptive Capital**

A novel form of productive capital with unique properties that drive economic impact:

:::{.callout}

#### Key Economic Properties:
1. **Dynamic Efficiency**: Self-improvement through machine learning drives productivity.
2. **Repurposability**: Flexible application to diverse compliance tasks.
3. **Scalability**: Low marginal costs enable rapid scaling.
4. **Labour Impact**: Augments high-skill roles and automates repetitive processes.
5. **Value Alignment**: Aligns AI objectives with societal and economic goals.

:::

### Implications for Regulatory Compliance:
- Reduced regulatory reporting times through **dynamic efficiency**.
- Scalable solutions for cost-effective compliance across firm sizes.
- Enhanced information access, reducing asymmetry in decision-making.

::: {.notes}
- Introduce AI as **adaptive capital**, highlighting its economic implications.
- Use examples like RAG models in compliance to connect AI properties to real-world applications.
- Explain how value alignment impacts regulatory compliance and labour dynamics.

## Economics of AI {.smaller}

**Economic Impacts of AI in Compliance**

![Economics of AI](imgs/RAGeconomics.png)

1. **Efficiency Gains**: Self-improving models reduce regulatory processing times.
2. **Cost Savings**: Scalability lowers compliance costs for SMEs.
3. **Labour Market Impact**: Augments high-skill roles, automates routine tasks.
4. **Risk Mitigation**: Flexible adaptation to regulatory updates reduces compliance risks.
5. **Information Accessibility**: Bridges knowledge gaps, enhancing decision quality.

### Why This Matters:
- AI transforms regulatory compliance into a scalable, efficient process.
- Balances cost-effectiveness with ethical considerations like transparency and fairness.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Quantified Challenges:

- Data Quality: Parsing accuracy starts at 70%, requiring preprocessing.
- Adaptability: Simulations show initial 3-week lag for updates; goal is 5 days.

### Addressing Concerns:

- Use explainable AI (XAI) for output transparency.
- Focus on modular integration with existing systems.
