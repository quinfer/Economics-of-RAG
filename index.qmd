# Project Summary

This project, led by Dr Barry Quinn and Dr Jesus Martinez Del Rincon from Queen’s University Belfast, aims to develop and assess an AI-based framework that enhances regulatory compliance within the global investment management sector. Specifically, it investigates the feasibility and economic viability of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models in automating and improving compliance tasks for smaller financial firms.

The project focuses on addressing common challenges in regulatory reporting, risk assessments, and compliance monitoring by using RAG models and ontology-based rule extraction. By translating complex regulatory texts into structured, actionable rules aligned with international standards, this framework aims to streamline compliance processes, reduce error rates, and ensure adherence to evolving regulations.

## Key Objectives

# Theoretical Framework in Economics

The feasibility study is grounded in a strong theoretical framework, incorporating economic principles to evaluate the potential value of RAG models in regulatory compliance. This framework supports a rigorous economic assessment of RAG model implementation, specifically within the context of a small financial firm with constrained compliance resources.

This section summarises key economic principles, providing context for the hybrid economic analysis methods employed in the project.

## Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness

RAG models have the potential to reduce compliance costs by automating complex regulatory tasks and enhancing process efficiency. From an economic perspective, efficiency gains are central to assessing the value of AI-driven tools in compliance. By minimising time and resource expenditure, RAG models align with cost-effectiveness principles critical for smaller firms seeking to optimise resource use.
	•	Economic Relevance: In this study, Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and Process Mapping will evaluate time and cost savings directly attributed to RAG model implementation.
	•	Supporting Literature: Agrawal et al. (2019) describe AI as a tool for reducing prediction costs, which is applicable here as RAG models reduce costs associated with interpreting regulatory requirements.

## Risk Mitigation and Value Creation

Implementing RAG models can be seen as an investment in risk mitigation. By automating regulatory interpretation, RAG models may reduce human error, thereby lowering the risk of non-compliance and potential regulatory penalties. This aligns with real options theory, which values flexibility in adapting to regulatory changes.
	•	Economic Relevance: Simulation Modelling will be used to assess RAG’s capacity to adapt to regulatory updates and mitigate non-compliance risks.
	•	Supporting Literature: Benaroch and Kauffman (1999) applied real options theory to IT investments, illustrating how flexible tools like RAG models create option value in regulatory environments by reducing uncertainty.

## Information Asymmetry Reduction

RAG models can help reduce information asymmetry by making complex regulatory information accessible to compliance officers and reducing the knowledge gap between regulatory bodies and compliance staff. Improved information flow and quick access to regulatory updates enable informed decision-making, enhancing compliance accuracy.
	•	Economic Relevance: Qualitative Interviews with compliance officers will explore the model’s role in bridging knowledge gaps and reducing information frictions, while CBA will estimate potential cost savings from reduced error rates.
	•	Supporting Literature: Goldfarb and Tucker (2019) discuss how AI reduces information frictions, an important concept for regulatory compliance, where access to clear, actionable information is critical.

## Scalability and Economies of Scale

The principle of economies of scale is relevant when considering the RAG model’s adaptability to different scales of operation. As RAG systems handle larger regulatory workloads or adapt to more complex compliance tasks, they can potentially reduce marginal costs, making them more attractive for small firms with limited budgets.
	•	Economic Relevance: Simulation Modelling will test scalability, projecting RAG’s performance in more complex regulatory contexts to determine whether economies of scale are achievable.
	•	Supporting Literature: Brynjolfsson et al. (2017) emphasise AI’s role in achieving economies of scale, which may be realised through improved efficiency and accuracy in RAG-driven compliance.

## Adaptability and Dynamic Efficiency

In a regulatory landscape that is constantly evolving, RAG models that demonstrate dynamic efficiency — the ability to adapt to new regulations quickly — provide long-term economic benefits. Tools that can swiftly incorporate updates or respond to regulatory changes reduce compliance risk and ensure ongoing adherence.
	•	Economic Relevance: The simulation of adaptability, particularly in WP3, will evaluate the economic implications of maintaining compliance across regulatory updates, focusing on the costs associated with system adaptation.
	•	Supporting Literature: Raisch and Krakowski (2021) examine AI’s role in organisational learning and adaptability, which is critical for RAG models in fast-paced regulatory environments.

## Summary

This theoretical framework informs the hybrid economic analysis, allowing for a multi-dimensional approach that considers both quantitative and qualitative insights. Each economic principle — cost-effectiveness, risk mitigation, information symmetry, economies of scale, and adaptability — is aligned with a specific method, enhancing the rigour and relevance of the project’s findings. These concepts provide a solid foundation for evaluating the real-world applicability of RAG models in compliance and are particularly pertinent to smaller firms operating with limited compliance resources.

# Potential Challenges and Limitations

While this project holds significant potential for advancing AI-driven regulatory compliance, several challenges and limitations must be considered. These challenges relate to technical, economic, and organisational aspects of implementing a RAG model in a small-scale, resource-constrained financial setting.

1. Data Quality and Availability

	•	Challenge: The effectiveness of RAG models depends heavily on access to high-quality, comprehensive regulatory data. Smaller firms, such as Funds Axis Ltd., may lack the breadth of data required for robust model training, particularly across diverse jurisdictions.
	•	Impact: Limited data could restrict the model’s ability to generalise effectively to new or complex regulatory queries, affecting accuracy and reliability.
	•	Mitigation: Focus initial development on high-priority, frequently encountered compliance tasks. Partner with regulatory data providers to supplement available information where possible.

2. Model Interpretability and User Trust

	•	Challenge: As RAG models become more complex, explaining their outputs and ensuring interpretability can be challenging. Compliance officers may be hesitant to trust AI-driven outputs without clear, transparent explanations.
	•	Impact: Lack of interpretability could reduce user confidence, especially in a high-stakes compliance context, potentially limiting RAG adoption within the firm.
	•	Mitigation: Integrate explainable AI (XAI) techniques to make RAG model outputs understandable and provide visual aids or simplified summaries to enhance user trust and usability.

3. Regulatory Acceptance and Auditability

	•	Challenge: Regulatory bodies may be sceptical of AI-driven compliance tools, particularly if these tools cannot be readily audited. Compliance with regulations often requires systems that provide a clear audit trail.
	•	Impact: Challenges in meeting regulatory audit standards could restrict the use of RAG models in compliance-sensitive applications or lead to higher scrutiny.
	•	Mitigation: Develop a logging and audit feature within the RAG model, recording outputs and decision pathways to provide transparent documentation for regulators and stakeholders.

4. Economic Feasibility for Small Firms

	•	Challenge: Although this project aims to make RAG models economically viable, there may be costs associated with initial implementation, model training, and ongoing adaptation that are challenging for small firms to absorb.
	•	Impact: High costs could hinder adoption, especially if cost savings are not realised in the short term or if additional resources are required for model maintenance.
	•	Mitigation: Emphasise cost-benefit analysis (CBA) and time-motion studies in WP1 and WP2 to ensure economic feasibility is continuously assessed. Provide insights on phased implementation or scaling options that match smaller firms’ budgets.

5. Integration with Existing Systems

	•	Challenge: Funds Axis Ltd. may already have established compliance systems and workflows. Integrating the RAG model into these existing systems may pose technical and operational challenges.
	•	Impact: Integration issues could limit the RAG model’s ability to enhance current workflows, potentially reducing the anticipated economic and operational benefits.
	•	Mitigation: Conduct a compatibility assessment with existing systems early in the project to identify integration challenges. Develop a modular RAG framework that can operate independently or complementarily to current tools if full integration proves difficult.

6. Continuous Learning and Adaptation Requirements

	•	Challenge: The regulatory landscape evolves continuously, and keeping the RAG model updated with the latest regulatory requirements could demand significant resources. Ensuring the model remains accurate and relevant over time may be operationally demanding.
	•	Impact: Without ongoing updates, the model’s usefulness may diminish, limiting its capacity to support compliance staff effectively and reducing its economic value.
	•	Mitigation: Implement a modular approach to model training and knowledge base updating, allowing for targeted updates in specific regulatory areas as they evolve. Explore potential partnerships or third-party solutions for regulatory updates if needed.

7. Limited Pool of Compliance Staff for Qualitative Data Collection

	•	Challenge: With only a small number of compliance professionals available for feedback at Funds Axis Ltd., gathering extensive qualitative insights may be challenging, limiting the depth of user experience data.
	•	Impact: A limited sample size could restrict the generalisability of user feedback, potentially impacting the reliability of qualitative assessments.
	•	Mitigation: Expand interview questions to gather rich, detailed insights from the available participants. Consider conducting follow-up interviews or using multiple data collection points to obtain longitudinal insights.

## Summary of Potential Challenges

Each of these challenges represents a potential limitation to the project’s success. The strategy will include ongoing risk assessments to address these challenges proactively, adapting the approach as needed to mitigate impacts on the RAG model’s technical and economic feasibility. By acknowledging and planning for these obstacles, the project will be better positioned to deliver a feasible, impactful solution that balances technical ambition with real-world constraints.


# Ethical Implications of AI in Regulatory Compliance

The use of AI, especially Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models, in regulatory compliance brings important ethical considerations that must be addressed to ensure responsible, fair, and transparent deployment. This section outlines key ethical issues relevant to this project and how they will be addressed.

1. Fairness and Bias

	•	Ethical Issue: AI models may inadvertently reinforce or amplify biases present in training data or algorithmic design. In a regulatory compliance context, biased decisions can lead to inconsistent or unfair compliance practices, potentially disadvantaging certain groups or entities.
	•	Mitigation: This project will carefully select and evaluate training data for RAG models, focusing on diverse regulatory texts to minimise inherent biases. Additionally, fairness metrics will be integrated into the model evaluation process to monitor for bias and ensure equal treatment across compliance tasks.

2. Accountability and Responsibility

	•	Ethical Issue: Determining accountability when AI systems make errors in regulatory compliance decisions can be challenging. With automated decision-making, it is essential to clarify responsibility, particularly when compliance outcomes impact clients, firms, or regulatory bodies.
	•	Mitigation: This project will implement accountability measures, including detailed logging of AI-driven decisions and the rationale behind them. A clear documentation framework will establish accountability between human operators and AI systems, providing a transparent record of how compliance decisions are made.

3. Privacy and Data Protection

	•	Ethical Issue: Processing vast amounts of potentially sensitive regulatory data raises concerns about data privacy and protection, especially with respect to compliance-sensitive information. Ensuring that AI models handle data securely is critical to protecting proprietary or personal information.
	•	Mitigation: Privacy-by-design principles will be integrated into the RAG model’s development. This includes robust data encryption, secure access controls, and compliance with data protection standards such as GDPR. Regular privacy audits will ensure that data handling and processing practices remain secure and compliant.

4. Transparency and Explainability

	•	Ethical Issue: The “black box” nature of many AI models can be problematic in compliance contexts, where transparency is often legally or ethically required. Stakeholders, including regulators and compliance officers, need to understand how AI-driven decisions are made to trust and validate the model’s outputs.
	•	Mitigation: To enhance transparency, explainable AI (XAI) techniques will be integrated into the RAG model, providing users with clear, interpretable insights into the model’s decision-making process. Visual explanations and summaries of RAG outputs will make complex AI decisions more accessible to compliance officers.

5. Human Oversight and Job Displacement

	•	Ethical Issue: While AI has the potential to increase efficiency, it also raises concerns about automation’s impact on human oversight and potential job displacement. Compliance officers may fear that AI-driven systems could reduce the demand for human roles in compliance, impacting job security.
	•	Mitigation: The RAG model will be designed as an augmentation tool to assist, rather than replace, compliance officers. Human oversight will remain integral to all compliance decisions, and the model will operate as a supportive tool that enhances, rather than replaces, human expertise. This approach will be communicated clearly to alleviate concerns about job displacement.

6. Regulatory Approval and Compliance

	•	Ethical Issue: AI-driven compliance tools must adhere to regulatory standards themselves. The deployment of RAG models must be demonstrably fair, accurate, and in line with the ethical principles laid out by relevant regulatory bodies. Non-compliance could result in ethical concerns and regulatory scrutiny.

Building on the insights and findings from this feasibility study, several areas for future research and development have emerged. These future directions aim to enhance the applicability, scalability, and robustness of RAG models in regulatory compliance, particularly as these tools continue to evolve within the financial sector.

1. Development of Specialised Financial Language Models

	•	Objective: Create language models specifically tailored to handle complex financial regulations and tasks, particularly for nuanced financial terminology and reasoning.
	•	Rationale: General-purpose language models (e.g., GPT-4, Llama) may not fully capture the intricacies of financial compliance. Specialised financial models, fine-tuned on domain-specific data, could improve accuracy and interpretability, reducing the risk of regulatory misunderstandings.
	•	Future Work: Develop and evaluate new language models focused on financial datasets or regulatory documents, potentially collaborating with financial institutions for access to anonymised data for training.

2. Improvement of Retrieval Mechanisms for Relevance and Accuracy

	•	Objective: Enhance RAG models’ retrieval capabilities to ensure that only the most relevant, high-quality regulatory information is used in generating responses.
	•	Rationale: Financial regulations are often complex, and ensuring that the most pertinent information is retrieved is crucial for accurate compliance guidance. Enhanced retrieval mechanisms could help reduce model “hallucinations” (incorrect or fabricated responses) and improve overall reliability.
	•	Future Work: Experiment with advanced retrieval techniques, such as context-aware retrieval or semantic search, to improve the precision and relevance of regulatory information retrieval within RAG models.

3. Methods to Mitigate Hallucinations in High-Stakes Applications

	•	Objective: Develop systematic approaches to reduce hallucinations, ensuring that RAG models consistently provide accurate and fact-based guidance.
	•	Rationale: In regulatory compliance, erroneous outputs can lead to significant financial and legal risks. Addressing hallucinations is critical to making RAG models safe for high-stakes financial decision-making.
	•	Future Work: Explore techniques such as fact-checking algorithms, integration with trusted knowledge bases, and post-processing filters to validate RAG outputs before they are delivered to compliance officers.

4. Integration of Structured Financial Data for Enhanced Compliance

	•	Objective: Combine unstructured text with structured financial data (e.g., tables, company filings) to enhance RAG models’ ability to handle multi-format compliance information.
	•	Rationale: Regulatory documents and compliance data are not always in text format; financial statements and structured data sources are common. Integrating these sources could improve RAG models’ ability to perform multi-step reasoning, numerical calculations, and cross-referencing.
	•	Future Work: Research methods for incorporating structured data alongside unstructured text, potentially using multimodal AI techniques, to enable RAG models to interpret and respond to complex financial queries.

5. Longitudinal Studies on Economic Impact of RAG in Compliance

	•	Objective: Conduct longitudinal studies to assess the evolving economic impact of RAG models on compliance costs, risk management, and operational efficiencies.
	•	Rationale: This feasibility study provides a short-term view of RAG’s impact. However, long-term studies would help quantify sustained economic benefits and identify areas for continuous improvement as regulations evolve and compliance needs increase.
	•	Future Work: Engage with partner institutions to track RAG model performance over multiple years, focusing on metrics such as cost savings, error reduction, risk mitigation, and adaptability to new regulations.

6. Exploration of Ethical and Regulatory Guidelines for AI in Compliance

	•	Objective: Develop frameworks for ethical AI deployment in regulatory compliance, focusing on fairness, transparency, privacy, and auditability.
	•	Rationale: With AI’s growing role in compliance, establishing ethical guidelines is essential to ensure that AI-driven compliance solutions are aligned with regulatory standards and public expectations. These guidelines could help address stakeholder concerns around trust and accountability.
	•	Future Work: Collaborate with regulatory bodies and industry leaders to establish best practices for AI use in compliance, including standards for model transparency, explainability, and privacy.
