# Potential Challenges and Limitations

While the project aims to deliver a comprehensive feasibility assessment, several potential challenges and limitations may impact the implementation of the RAG model in regulatory compliance. Addressing these issues proactively will help mitigate potential risks and ensure that the findings remain practical and relevant.

- **Data quality and availability:** The RAG model’s effectiveness depends on the quality and completeness of the regulatory data used for training. Smaller firms may have limited access to comprehensive regulatory data across various jurisdictions, which could affect the model’s performance. To address this, the project will focus on priority compliance tasks and, where possible, supplement data with external regulatory resources.

- **Model interpretability and user trust:** Compliance professionals may have concerns about the interpretability of AI-driven compliance recommendations, which could impact trust and adoption. Providing clear explanations of the RAG model’s outputs will be essential to ensuring user confidence. Integrating explainable AI (XAI) techniques and providing user-friendly explanations are planned to support transparency.

- **Regulatory acceptance and auditability:** Ensuring that the RAG model meets regulatory requirements and can be audited is critical in compliance contexts. Regulatory bodies may require a clear audit trail for AI-driven decisions. This project will include logging and auditing features in the RAG model to record outputs and decision pathways, supporting transparency and alignment with regulatory standards.

- **Economic feasibility for SMEs** While RAG models have the potential to improve efficiency, initial costs for implementation and ongoing maintenance could be a barrier for smaller firms. The project’s cost-benefit analysis will provide insights into expected cost savings and long-term economic viability, offering practical recommendations for phased or modular implementation if necessary.

- **Integration with existing systems:** Funds Axis Ltd. may already have established compliance workflows and tools. Integrating the RAG model with these existing systems may require additional technical adaptation. The project team will conduct an early compatibility assessment and develop a modular RAG framework to enable seamless or complementary integration with current systems.

- **Continuous learning and adaptation:** Regulatory environments are constantly evolving, requiring compliance tools to be regularly updated to maintain accuracy. The project team will explore options for modular updates to keep the RAG model current with regulatory changes, reducing the operational burden on compliance teams while ensuring adaptability.

- **Limited pool of compliance staff for qualitative data collection:** Funds Axis Ltd. has a small compliance team, which may limit the sample size for qualitative insights. To address this, the project will conduct in-depth interviews and follow-up sessions with available participants to gather detailed feedback over multiple data collection points, helping to capture valuable user perspectives.

Each of these challenges represents a potential area for adjustment throughout the project. By anticipating these limitations, the project strategy includes ongoing risk assessments to ensure that both technical and economic feasibility remain central to development and final recommendations.

# Ethical Implications of AI in Regulatory Compliance

The deployment of AI models, especially in regulatory compliance, raises several ethical considerations. Ensuring that the RAG model is implemented responsibly will be essential for its acceptance and effectiveness. Key ethical issues and mitigation strategies are outlined below.

- Fairness and Bias: AI models may unintentionally introduce or reinforce biases present in the training data, potentially leading to inconsistent compliance outcomes. To mitigate this, the project will carefully curate the dataset, prioritising diverse regulatory sources, and will use fairness metrics to monitor for potential bias in outputs. 

- Accountability and Responsibility: Defining accountability is critical, particularly when an AI model is used to support high-stakes compliance decisions. The project will establish clear documentation to track AI-assisted decisions, ensuring that responsibility between human operators and the AI system is well-defined. This approach will support accountability and transparency. 

- Privacy and Data Protection: Compliance tools often process sensitive and proprietary data, raising concerns around data privacy. The RAG model will incorporate privacy-by-design principles, including robust encryption and secure access protocols, to ensure that data protection standards, such as GDPR, are maintained throughout its use. 

- Transparency and Explainability: Ensuring that the AI model’s outputs are understandable is crucial for compliance officers to trust and effectively use the RAG system. To address this, the project will implement explainable AI (XAI) techniques, providing transparent explanations of how recommendations are generated. This will support informed decision-making by compliance staff. 

- Human Oversight and Job Impact: AI tools can significantly enhance efficiency, but there may be concerns about automation impacting job roles in compliance. This project emphasises that the RAG model is intended as a support tool to assist, rather than replace, compliance professionals. Human oversight will remain central to the workflow, maintaining a balance between AI-driven efficiency and the expertise of compliance staff. 

- Regulatory Compliance of AI Systems: AI-driven compliance tools themselves must meet certain regulatory and ethical standards. To ensure that the RAG model is aligned with these requirements, the project will incorporate regular reviews of regulatory guidelines on AI use in financial compliance. Where guidelines are ambiguous, best practices will be followed to maintain high ethical standards.

By proactively addressing these ethical considerations, the project aims to ensure that the RAG model aligns with principles of fairness, accountability, and privacy. These measures will help build trust among compliance officers and stakeholders, supporting responsible AI use in regulatory compliance.

# Future Work Ideas

Building on the insights from this feasibility study, several directions for future research and development could further enhance the capabilities of RAG models in regulatory compliance. These ideas focus on extending the applicability, reliability, and adaptability of AI models within the compliance landscape.

- Specialised Financial Language Models: Future research could explore the development of language models specifically trained on financial and regulatory texts. Such models would be better equipped to handle complex regulatory language and reasoning, potentially improving accuracy and interpretability for high-stakes compliance tasks. 

- Enhanced Retrieval Mechanisms: Improving the retrieval accuracy of RAG models would help ensure that the most relevant regulatory information is surfaced in response to compliance queries. Advanced retrieval techniques, such as semantic search or context-aware filtering, could further reduce inaccuracies and improve relevance. 

- Mitigating Hallucinations in High-Stakes Applications: Developing systematic methods to reduce hallucinations (incorrect or fabricated outputs) will be essential for ensuring that RAG models provide reliable guidance. Fact-checking algorithms and integration with verified knowledge bases could be effective in improving output accuracy. 

- Integration of Structured Financial Data: Regulatory compliance often requires handling structured data, such as financial statements. Future work could focus on integrating structured and unstructured data within RAG models, enhancing their ability to perform tasks that involve numerical reasoning and cross-referencing. 

- Longitudinal Studies on Economic Impact: Conducting long-term studies to assess the ongoing economic impact of RAG models would provide valuable insights into cost efficiencies and scalability. By tracking performance over time, future research could quantify sustained benefits, such as reduced error rates and ongoing compliance efficiencies. 

- Ethical and Regulatory Guidelines for AI in Compliance: As AI adoption in compliance grows, developing ethical frameworks and best practices specific to this context will be essential. Future efforts could focus on creating industry standards for fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI-driven compliance.

These areas for future work could help to refine and expand the applicability of RAG models, creating more reliable and flexible compliance tools. These research directions would provide a foundation for ongoing advancements in AI applications for regulatory compliance, supporting a more efficient and responsive compliance landscape.
