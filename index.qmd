## Introduction

**Collaborative Project Overview**  

- Led by Queen's University Belfast researchers in the [Finance and AI Research Lab](https://q-rap.connect.qub.ac.uk/FAIR/)

- Industry Partner Funds Axis Ltd, a leading RegTech firm in Northern Ireland 

- Supported by UKRI through the UKFin+ programme.  

- Aim: Evaluate the feasibility of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models for enhancing regulatory compliance within FinTech.

::: {.notes}
- Briefly introduce the project team and the event context.
- Mention this study is part of a broader UKFin+ initiative to explore cutting-edge financial technologies.
:::

## Objectives

1. Evaluate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models for:
   - Regulatory reporting,
   - Risk assessments,
   - Monitoring processes.
2. Quantify economic efficiency through cost-benefit analysis and process mapping.
3. Address challenges in adaptability, interpretability, and usability.
4. Provide actionable insights for AI-driven compliance systems.

::: {.notes}
- Highlight that the focus is on AI applications within compliance workflows.
- Emphasise the combination of economic analysis with technical evaluation to create practical recommendations.

## Towards a Unified Definition of AI {.smalller}

### AI as Adaptive Capital

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**:  

:::{.aside}
A novel form of **adaptive capital**, capable of dynamic learning, autonomous decision-making, and task flexibility, designed to achieve specific objectives efficiently.
:::

:::{.callout}

#### Key properties:  
- **Dynamic Efficiency**: Self-improving through machine learning.  
- **Repurposability**: Adaptable to diverse tasks.  
- **Scalability**: Low marginal costs, enabling rapid expansion.  
- **Labour Dynamics**: Both complement and substitute for human skills.  
- **Value Alignment**: Ensures AI objectives align with societal and economic goals.
:::

::: {.notes}
- Define "adaptive capital" as a foundational concept for AIâ€™s economic role.
- Provide an example, e.g., AI in regulatory compliance, to show task flexibility and efficiency.
- Explain why value alignment is critical in both technical and economic contexts.
:::

## Economic Properties of AI

#### Key Implications of Adaptive Capital

1. **Dynamic Efficiency**: Continuous self-improvement enhances productivity.
2. **Repurposability**: Application to diverse regulatory compliance tasks.
3. **Scalability**: Processes scale at low additional costs.
4. **Labour Impact**: Augments high-skill tasks; automates repetitive processes.
5. **Value Alignment**: Critical for sustainable economic growth.

::: {.notes}
â€¢	Use the visual to show how the properties of AI feed into economic impacts.
â€¢	Discuss specific examples, e.g., how dynamic efficiency reduces regulatory reporting times.
â€¢	Emphasise the dual role of AI as both complement and substitute in labour markets.

## Implications for Policy and Economics

### Aligning AI with Economic Goals

1.	Value Alignment: Align AIâ€™s objectives with human welfare.
2.	Policy Challenges: Address labour displacement through upskilling and incentives.
3.	Scalability & Risk: Leverage AIâ€™s scalability while mitigating potential inequities.
4.	Structural Changes: Long-term shifts in growth models and comparative advantages.

::: {.notes}
â€¢	Highlight that policy must evolve alongside AIâ€™s economic impact.
â€¢	Use examples like ESG compliance AI to show the need for alignment between AI goals and regulatory requirements.
â€¢	Stress the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to AI policy-making.

## Methodology Overview

Hybrid Economic Analysis Framework

1.	Process Mapping: Establish baseline workflows and resource allocation.
2.	Cost-Benefit Analysis: Quantify direct and indirect cost savings.
3.	Simulation Modelling: Test adaptability of RAG models to evolving regulations.
4.	Stakeholder Feedback: Gather practical insights on usability and challenges.


## Economic Methodology Overview

![Hybrid Economic Analysis Framework](mermaid-diagram-2024-11-19-113920.png)

::: {.notes}
â€¢	Use the flowchart to explain how input data feeds into various analysis components.
â€¢	Highlight the interconnected nature of process mapping, CBA, simulation, and feedback.
â€¢	Emphasise how this framework ensures both technical and economic feasibility are addressed.
:::

## Preliminary Insights

1.	RAG models are projected to reduce task time by 40%, saving ~20 staff hours weekly.
2.	Early tests highlight improved interpretability for ESG reporting and risk assessments.
3.	Stakeholders report an 8/10 usability score for compliance-related tasks.

## Work Packages {.scrollable}

### WP1: Use Case Definition & Data Collection

â€¢	Focus: Map 3 priority compliance workflows.
â€¢	Deliverable: Baseline time/resource metrics.
â€¢	Tool: Lucidchart for workflow visualisation.

### WP2: Question-Answering (Q/A) Model

â€¢	Focus: Fine-tune a regulatory-specific Q/A model.
â€¢	Deliverable: First prototype tested for ESG compliance tasks.

### WP3: Rule Extraction & Knowledge Base

â€¢	Focus: Automate rule extraction using OWL ontology.
â€¢	Deliverable: Dynamic knowledge base with 500+ structured rules.

## Challenges and Limitations

### Quantified Challenges:

â€¢	Data Quality: Parsing accuracy starts at 70%, requiring preprocessing.
â€¢	Adaptability: Simulations show initial 3-week lag for updates; goal is 5 days.

### Addressing Concerns:

â€¢	Use explainable AI (XAI) for output transparency.
â€¢	Focus on modular integration with existing systems.

## Ethical Considerations

â€¢	Fairness: Minimise bias via curated datasets.
â€¢	Accountability: Establish clear documentation for decision trails.
â€¢	Human Oversight: Support compliance professionals without replacing roles.

## Future Work

1.	Train domain-specific language models for finance.
2.	Enhance retrieval accuracy using semantic search.
3.	Explore long-term cost and efficiency gains via real-world trials.
