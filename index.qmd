## Project Summary 

- This project, led by Dr. Barry Quinn and Dr. JesÃºs MartÃ­nez del RincÃ³n from Queenâ€™s University Belfast, aims to create an AI framework to simplify and enhance regulatory compliance in global investment management. 

- First major project for [Finance and AI Research lab](https://q-rap.connect.qub.ac.uk/FAIR/) established in 2023.

- The research focuses on **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and ontology learning algorithms to transform complex regulatory texts into clear, consistent rules reflecting current international standards.

- **Study Period 1/11/2024 - 31/10/2024**

## Key Objectives

- Explore the advantages of AI in regulatory compliance for the investment management sector.
- Evaluate AIâ€™s impact on accuracy, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
- Focus on key areas like regulatory reporting, risk assessments, and compliance monitoring.
- Address challenges in using Large Language Models (LLMs), including hallucinations, reasoning, and auditability.

::: {.callout}
- **Funding**: UKRI through the UKFin+ program for a 12-month period; FEC Â£99,871 (Nov 2024 - Oct 2025).  

- **Industrial Partner**: [Funds Axis Ltd](https://funds-axis.com/) provides support and industry insights.

## Work Package 1: Use Case Definition, Data Collection & Process Mapping

#### Regulatory Focus
- **Codification of Investment Regulations**:
    - Focus on [EFAMA European Fund Classification Categories](https://www.efama.org/SitePages/EFCF.aspx).
    - Rules for portfolio composition (e.g., asset class restrictions on equities, bonds, and country/industry limits).
    - Compare regulatory limits with existing portfolios to ensure compliance.
- **Document Analysis**:
    - Use RAG to analyse multiple versions of regulatory texts for overlaps, inconsistencies, and conflicting rules.

## Proposed Use Cases
1. **Portfolio Compliance**:
    - Leverage Funds Axis's classified spreadsheet for model training.
    - Train models to validate portfolio adherence to regulations.
    - Identify conflicting rules across versions.
2. **Advanced Legal Analysis**:
    - Address complex regulations from authorities like the FCA.
    - Extract logic from dense legal language for future use cases.
    - For example Investment and Borrowing powers for UCITS from the FCA <https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/COLL/5/2.pdf>

## Next Steps

1. **Define First Use Case**:
    - Review regulatory documents shared by Funds Axis.
    - Develop the portfolio compliance framework for initial testing.
2. **Plan In-Person Meeting**:
    - Visit Funds Axis to review workflows and processes.
    - Map detailed use cases for inclusion in Work Package 1.

:::{.notes}
- Transition to upcoming actions for clarity.
- Emphasise collaboration with Funds Axis and the importance of mapping workflows.

## Theoretical Framework in Economics

**Artificial Intelligence (AI) as Adaptive Capital**

A novel form of productive capital with unique properties that drive economic impact:

:::{.callout-important}

#### Key Economic Properties:
1. **Dynamic Efficiency**: Self-improvement through machine learning drives productivity.
2. **Repurposability**: Flexible application to diverse compliance tasks.
3. **Scalability**: Low marginal costs enable rapid scaling.
4. **Labour Impact**: Augments high-skill roles and automates repetitive processes.
5. **Value Alignment**: Aligns AI objectives with societal and economic goals.

:::

### Implications for Regulatory Compliance:
- Reduced regulatory reporting times through **dynamic efficiency**.
- Scalable solutions for cost-effective compliance across firm sizes.
- Enhanced information access, reducing asymmetry in decision-making.

::: {.notes}
- Introduce AI as **adaptive capital**, highlighting its economic implications.
- Use examples like RAG models in compliance to connect AI properties to real-world applications.
- Explain how value alignment impacts regulatory compliance and labour dynamics.
